I created a sketch in which two sprites, a bowling ball and a bowling pin are drawn using functions. The bowling pin sprite spawns randomly and the bowling ball moves to the pin to "collect" it. When the bowling ball interacts with the bowling pin, I made it so the bowling ball turns red. The code defines the variables for the bowling ball and the bowling pin, and sets their initial positions, size, and speed. It also sets the color of the ball. The setup function randomly positions the pin within the canvas. The keyPressed function makes the ball move towards the pin when the right arrow key is pressed. If the ball collides with the pin, the color of the ball changes to red and the pin disappears. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to figure out how to “Spawn the 5 items randomly until the character gets them all”.
